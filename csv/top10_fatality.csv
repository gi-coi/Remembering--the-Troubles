1998,West Tyrone,"Wilson, Lorraine",Explosion,28,"A car bomb planted by the Real IRA (rIRA) near Market Street killed 28 people (29 according to some accounts). The group had given a 40-minute warning, but the Royal Ulster Constabulary had secured the Omagh Courthouse, a nearby building.<br>
The killings came as a shock to the community and politicians and threatened to endanger the fragile peace process.
After claiming responsibility for the attack, the rIRA issued a second statement provisionally suspending military operations.","Omagh, 15th August 1998"
1974,Dublin and Monaghan,"O'Brien, John",Explosion,25,"This was a series of coordinated car bombings in Dublin and Monaghan, launched between 5.30pm and 7.00pm in May 1974. The first three bombs went off in the centre of Dublin: Parnell Street, Talbot Street and South Leinster Street. The fourth exploded in North Road, Monaghan. 25 people (or 33 according to some sources) were killed in the attacks and more than 250 were injured. This was the greatest loss of lives in a single day of conflict.<br>
In the aftermath of the events, no group claimed responsibility. In 1993, following a TV broadcast titled <em>Hidden Hand - The Forgotten Massacre</em> sparked fresh debate, suggesting the British security forces had aided loyalist paramilitary groups. Eventually, the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) admitted responsibility.","Dublin and Monaghan, 17th May 1974"
1974,Birmingham,"Davis, Jane",Explosion,20,"Two bombs went off at two public houses in Birmingham, the Mulberry Bush and the Tavern in the Town, killing 21 and injuring more than 200.<br>
In 1975, six men, who became known as the Birmingham Six, were convicted for murder. In 1991, following a new trial, the Court of Appeal ruled in their favour and the six were released. Campaigns for justice continued, and in 2016 the HM Senior Coroner for Birmingham ruled to reopen the inquest in 2016, given there was sufficient evidence to support a judicial review.<br>In April 2019, the jury ruled the IRA was responsible for the killings. The relatives of the victims announced the inquest is ""only the beginning"" and they will continue campaigning for justice.","Birmingham, 21st November 1974"
1979,South Down,"Rogers, Ian",Explosion,17,"Two remote-controlled bombs placed by The Irish Republican Army (IRA) blew up killing 18 British soldiers and one civilian in County Down, near the Irish border.<br>
The bombs were hidden in a parked truck and exploded as the army's vehicles passed by on the road between Newry and Warrenpoint.
Historians point to this event as the attack that triggered London's policy of ""Ulsterisation"", aimed at turning the conflict into an ""Irish problem"" by gradually withdrawing while enhancing the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC)'s powers and capabilities.","Narrow Water massacre, 27th August 1979"
1982,East Londonderry,"Smith, Stephen",Explosion,17,"A time bomb placed by the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) exploded at a disco in Ballykelly, Northern Ireland. The nightclub was chosen as a target because it was frequented by British Army soldiers stationed in the Shackleton Barracks nearby. The bomb was placed near a supporting pillar, and the explosion brought down the roof.<br>
17 people (11 soldiers and 6 civilians) were killed and 30 were injured. In 1986, four members of the INLA were convicted for murder. ","Droppin Well bombing, 6th December 1982"
1971,North Belfast,"Cromie, James",Explosion,15,"Though it took place early on in the Troubles, this attack is the largest loss of civilian life until the Ormagh attacks in 1998. In a December evening of 1971, a no-warning bomb planted by the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) exploded on the door of a family pub in North Belfast, killing 15 people.<br>
Official accounts from the government and the police initially pointed to the IRA, but the UVF eventually emerged as those truly responsible. An UVG volunteer was convicted in 1982, but the inquest had an ""open verdict"" because the correct perpetrators were never found. In 2014, the police ombudsman in Northern Ireland acknowledged the police investigation in 1971 had been biased and had failed to consider the evidence available.<br>The families' attorneys allege the British state was involved in a cover-up operation and requested the reopening of the case, but the attorney general rejected the request in 2018.","Mc Gurk's massacre, 4th December 1971"
1972,Foyle,"Doherty, Patrick",Gun Battle,14,"The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association had organised a march against a new law that allowed authorities to jail people without trial. 15,000 people marched on the streets of Derry, despite the fact the government had banned the protests.<br>
Clashes broke out between some demonstrators and the army, that had been deployed to police the protests. At first, soldiers responded with rubber bullets. Then, they opened fire on the crowd. 13 people were killed and 15 people were wounded.
In 1998, British Prime Minister Tony Blair initiated an inquiry into the events, known as Saville Inquiry. The final report, published in 2010, acknowledged none of the casualties had acted in such a way that would justify the army's response, and no warning had been given to the demonstrators.<br>
After almost 50 years of campaigns, in March 2019 Northern Ireland's Public Prosecutor Service announced it would prosecute a paratrooper known as Soldier F for the murders of two demonstrators, William McKinney and James Wray.","Bloody Sunday, 30th January 1972"
1974,"M62 Motorway, England","Godden, Leonard",Explosion,12,"A coach carrying off-duty British Army soldiers and family members was travelling on the M62 motorway near Oakwell Hall, Yorkshire, when a bomb placed by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) on the vehicle exploded. 12 people (9 soldiers and 3 civilians) were killed, and 38 were injured.<br>
A woman named Judith Ward was sentenced in 1974, but her conviction was overturned in 1992, when it was found the police had concealed some facts and manipulated Ward's confession during the investigation. The true perpetrators have never been found.","M62 coach bombing, 4th February 1974"
1978,Strangford,"Crothers, Joan",Explosion,12,"12 people died and 30 were injured after the explosion of and incendiary bomb planted outside the restaurant at La Mon House Hotel, in Gransha. The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility for the event but acknowledged it had been an ""accident"". It also alleged it had given an ""inadequate"" nine-minute warning to the police because the nearest public telephone had been vandalised.<br>
An inquiry by the Historical Inquiries Team (HET) revealed some police documents regarding the events had gone lost. Families requested a new public inquiry, but secretary of State Theresa Villiers refused to do so, stating she would not believe another investigation would uncover fresh evidence or reach a different conclusion.","La Mon House Hotel, February 1978"
