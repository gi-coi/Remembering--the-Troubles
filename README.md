<p>This university project is a series of data visualisations of the victims of the Troubles, from 1969 to 2005. It is based on Michael McKeown's database, which remains copyright of the author but can be <a href='https://cain.ulster.ac.uk/victims/mckeown/' target='_blank'>downloaded</a> for free for research purposes.</p>
<p>See the final work <a href='https://gi-coi.github.io/remembering-the-Troubles/' target='_blank'>here</a>.</p>
